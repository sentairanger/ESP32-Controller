# ESP32-Controller
This is the repository for my ESP32 controller which I built thanks to PCB Way. Since this board works I will opensource the design so others can modify as they want and make the gerber files available if anyone wants to have their own controller.

Full Disclosure: Thanks to Emily and PCB Way for this collaboration and sending me the boards. Click this [link](https://www.pcbway.com/) to get started. PCBWay sells not just PCBs they also provide CNC Machining, 3D Printing and offer fast turnaround as fast as 24 hours. 

## Files Contained

* `esp32_2.zip`: Zip files that contain the Gerber files for the controller. Perfect for those who want to use PCBWay.
* `esp32_controller.fzz`: Fritzing file that can be used to modify the design as you wish.
* `esp32_controller_pcb.jpg`: PCB Design
* `tests`: Directory containing tests for the buttons and Potentiometer. Use this to test the PCB's functionality.
